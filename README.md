# Cooking Cortana # 

Welcome to Cooking Cortana! This is a hackathon project by Arthur Silverstein and Calvin Wang. This is our first project with Microsoft Azure's Botframework at UCSB's first Cortana Hackathon! 

## Objective ## 

Our goal here is to create a skill on Cortana where they can take a step by step recipe and follow along with an individual as they cook. We want this skill to act like an assistant standing next to our users answering any questions a cook may have before going onto the next step. For example, if one forgets how many eggs to include in the batter, or how many teaspoons of spice to add in the chili, he or she can easily inquire Cortana before telling Cortana to move onto the next step. Initially, we will be hardcoding examples into the framework, but we aim to integrate our app with Spoonacular's Recipe API for a larger database of recipes, and a form of intelligence in the future to scale. onto any recipe handed into our skill.
